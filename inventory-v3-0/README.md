# Introduction #
This is a sample project showcasing how you can use [InStoreMetadata APIs](http://dev.xomni.com/v3-0/http-api/public-apis/catalog/item-in-store-metadata) to see stock details of products for a spesific store or look-up across multiple stores for availability. Even though in this document we are only going to discuss inventory aspect of our APIs, InStoreMetadata APIs are designed in a generic way to give you flexibility implementing different scenarios where you might need store specific contextual data.

# What is "In-Store Metadata?" #
In-Store Metadata is a **store based** metadata that may be used to store contextual and optional data about an item.

# How to Support Inventory With In-Store Metadata#
In "**Inventory Sample App**", it is used in 2 different ways:

- **Fetch a single item**, check if it's available to buy.
- If it's not available, see other stores the product can be bought from by **fetching the in-store metadata across multiple stores**.

After fetching the in-store metadata across multiple stores, we represented them in a map that is provided by Bing Maps. You can find the reference link at the bottom.

Two different instore metadata has been created for sample items in this project. One of them was for showing the **item availability**, another one was for showing the **quantity**.

**Example Response:**

	{
	  "Data": [
	    {
	      "Metadata": [
	        {
	          "Key": "instock",
	          "Value": "true"
	        },
	        {
	          "Key": "instock_quantity",
	          "Value": "25"
	        }
	      ],
	      "Id": 1,
	      "Description": "",
	      "Location": {
	        "Longitude": -75.952559,
	        "Latitude": 40.801135
	      },
	      "Name": "XOMNI Sample Store Name",
	      "Address": "112 East 106th Street, New York"
	    }
	  ]
	}


If you **fetch a single item** to view its in-store metadata, you can do it only for the **current store** (which is associated with your license). If you want to view it across **multiple stores**, you should do a **company wide** search instead.

XOMNI InStoreMetadata APIs provide **two options** for a **company wide** search. You can either use a "**key-value**" pair to fetch **exact information** you need or you can use a "**keyprefix**". 

While "**key-value**" pair is a **clean** way of searching, "**keyprefix**" is a more **flexible** way as you can fetch multiple metadata matching your magic word.

All steps are explained in detail below.

#How To#

## Fetch a Single Item ##

Fetching a single item is fairly easy. All you need to do is to use the **GetAsync** method of **ItemClient**. As always, you need to create a 
**clientcontext** instance with **valid credentials** and a **valid tenant URL** first.

**Note:** If you're going to fetch a single item to see InStore Metadata of an item for **your store**, make sure the Store ID associated with your **license** is defined in the InStore Metadata.

**Usage:**

	    using (ClientContext clientContext = new ClientContext("UserName","Password","Service URL"))
	    {
	        var itemClient = new clientContext.Of<ItemClient>();
            var sampleItem = await itemClient.GetAsync(ItemId, includeItemInStoreMetadata :true, 
			imageAssetDetail: AssetDetailType.IncludeOnlyDefault);
	    }


Make sure you set "**includeItemInStoreMetadata**" paramater to **true** as we're going to use InStoreMetadata of the item to see stock details.

**Possible Enumarable Values for AssetDetailTypes:**

 - **0** : Default Value â€“ Image assets are not included in response.
 - **1** : Includes only default image asset.
 - **2** : Includes only default image asset with metadata
 - **4** : Includes all image assets
 - **8** : Includes all image assets with metadata

After fetching the Item you desire, you can simply use the **InStoreMetadata** of the item to see if the product is **in stock**. 

**Example Response:**
	


	"InStoreMetadata":[
				{
					"Key":"instock",
					"Value":"false"
				}],

## Fetching the In-Store Metadata Across Multiple Stores ##
If you need the **In-Store Metadata** of an item **for all stores**, you need to use the **GetAsync** method of **ItemInStoreMetadataClient**. 

If you provide a location, In-Store Metadata search query will be executed on stores nearby to given location. When you execute a location based search,you must set companyWide parameter to true.

**Note:** Search distance is Maximum search distance in miles for given search location.

**Usage:**

Fetching in-store metadata has two different ways. You can use a **key-value** pair or a **keyprefix**.

**Using Key-Value Pair:**

	using (ClientContext clientContext = new ClientContext("UserName","Password","Service URL"))
    {
		var myLocation = new Location { Longitude = -75.952134, Latitude = 40.801112 };
		var itemInStoreMetadataClient = new clientContext.Of<ItemInStoreMetadataClient>();
		var metadataList = await itemInStoreMetadataClient.GetAsync(ItemId,key: "instock", value: "true",companyWide: true,
		location: myLocation,searchDistance: 1);
    }

If your search includes a **key-value** pair (e.g. key= "instock" value= "true"), you will get only the **exact matching results**.

**Example Response:**

	{
	  "Data": [
	    {
	      "Metadata": [
	        {
	          "Key": "instock",
	          "Value": "true"
	        }
	      ],
	      "Id": 1,
	      "Description": "",
	      "Location": {
	        "Longitude": -75.952559,
	        "Latitude": 40.801135
	      },
	      "Name": "XOMNI Sample Store Name",
	      "Address": "112 East 106th Street, New York"
	    },
	    {
	      "Metadata": [
	        {
	          "Key": "instock",
	          "Value": "true"
	        }
	      ],
	      "Id": 2,
	      "Description": "",
	      "Location": {
	        "Longitude": -75.953134,
	        "Latitude": 40.801235
	      },
	      "Name": "XOMNI Store,
	      "Address": "105 East 106th Street, New York"
	    }
	  ]
	}

----------


**Using KeyPrefix:**

	using (ClientContext clientContext = new ClientContext("UserName","Password","Service URL"))
    {
		var myLocation = new Location { Longitude = -75.952134, Latitude = 40.801112 };
		var itemInStoreMetadataClient = new clientContext.Of<ItemInStoreMetadataClient>();
		var metadataList = await itemInStoreMetadataClient.GetAsync(ItemId,keyprefix: "instock",companyWide: true,
		location: myLocation,searchDistance: 1);
    }

However, if you search with a **keyprefix** (e.g. keyprefix= **"instock"**), you can fetch **more than one key** including your keyprefix.


**Example Response:**

	{
	  "Data": [
	    {
	      "Metadata": [
	        {
	          "Key": "instock",
	          "Value": "true"
	        },
	        {
	          "Key": "instock_quantity",
	          "Value": "25"
	        }
	      ],
	      "Id": 1,
	      "Description": "",
	      "Location": {
	        "Longitude": -75.952559,
	        "Latitude": 40.801135
	      },
	      "Name": "XOMNI Sample Store Name",
	      "Address": "112 East 106th Street, New York"
	    },
	    {
	      "Metadata": [
	        {
	          "Key": "instock",
	          "Value": "true"
	        },
	        {
	          "Key": "instock_quantity",
	          "Value": "25"
	        }
	      ],
	      "Id": 2,
	      "Description": "",
	      "Location": {
	        "Longitude": -75.953134,
	        "Latitude": 40.801235
	      },
	      "Name": "XOMNI Store,
	      "Address": "105 East 106th Street, New York"
	    }
	  ]
